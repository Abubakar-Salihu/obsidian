# Obsidian.md for Academic Writing 📝

**Obsidian.md** is a powerful note-taking app that allows you to create and link notes in a network of knowledge. It is especially useful for academic writing, as it helps you to organize your research, literature, and citations in a flexible and intuitive way. Here are some of the features of Obsidian.md that make it suitable for academic writing:

- You can connect **Zotero**, a popular reference manager, to Obsidian.md and import your bibliographic data and PDF annotations into your notes¹². 📚
- You can use **Markdown syntax** to format your notes, insert citations, and create tables, lists, and headings. Markdown is a simple and widely used markup language that can be easily converted to other formats such as Word, HTML, or LaTeX²⁶. ✍️
- You can use **plugins and templates** to enhance your note-taking experience, such as Dataview, which lets you query and display your notes in various ways, or LaTeX-like figures and section referencing, which mimic the functionality of LaTeX in Obsidian.md⁴⁶. 🧩
- You can visualize and navigate your notes in a **graph view**, which shows you how your notes are linked and related to each other. This can help you to find connections, gaps, and insights in your research³⁵. 🌐
